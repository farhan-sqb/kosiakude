    <h1>Effects of covid 19 and Brexit on E business in Ireland</h1>
    <p>COVID-19 accelerated the move to digital for Irish consumers, with 68% doing more online shopping now than they did before the pandemic.</p>
    <p>The research found that businesses with well-established and user-friendly digital channels had a clear advantage, with 99% of Irish consumers saying that a good website is important.  But while Irish consumers are happy to digitally self-serve, they expect to be able to access human support when needed. Respondents to the survey said that a human webchat was more important (95%) than having a mobile app (84%).</p>
