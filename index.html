    <h1>Quartz Buissness</h1>
    <p>At Quartz, there is an opportunity to build something new every day, whether that’s taking up a new obsession, learning a new language, or trying something new in an ad unit. We always look for the chance to do things boldly, and with bracing creativity to produce the greatest work we could aspire to and we take pride in the hard work of doing so.</p>
    <p>Quartz is defined, more than anything, by the people who work here. We’re all different, but share a common affinity for that #qzlife.</p>

    <h1>Our mission is to make business better.</h1>
    <p>We believe companies should solve real problems without creating new ones. The global economy must be as inclusive as it is innovative, balance financial incentives with the needs of our planet, and elevate leaders who act with integrity, empathy, and foresight.</p>
    <p>Quartz was founded in 2012 to be the greatest ally and resource for purpose-driven professionals in search of these new approaches to business. Our journalists around the world produce smart and insightful analysis of the global economy. We help our readers discover new industries, new markets, and new ways of doing business that are more sustainable, innovative, and inclusive.</p>
